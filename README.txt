CS 583: 3D Game Programming

Fall 2024

    Compared to the one pager, there are some things that have changed from the planned additions to the game.

    For one, the game was supposed to be based off of Dead Ops Arcade, a mini game mode included in Call of Duty: Black Ops. There were different paths in the game, but in my game it is just the same area that we are playing in. As noted in the one pager, my worry was that the enemies would not path properly if there was a barrier blocking between them and the player. I removed barriers within the map itself for all assets to move freely. I did not add power ups or drops in the game.

    Controls were kept the same.

    Art assets-wise, instead of dots I added different sprites and prefabs from the internet into this game. Regular enemies just run at you and try to hit you, while there were two special enemies that were able to shoot at you.

    Sounds wise, it was mainly assets I found online. Some soundboard effects were used.

    Game flow is about the same as in the one pager, but instead of spawning in the middle after getting hit, the player is invincible for 3 seconds, and is signified by the flashing. After all three lives are used, then you have the option of restarting the level.

    Challenges were overcome in the assets department. Everything else was about as expected.
